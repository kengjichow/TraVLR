# TraVLR

### Introduction

TraVLR is a dataset for evaluation of visio-linguistic reasoning and cross-modal transfer. 

Paper: [TraVLR: Now You See It, Now You Don't! A Bimodal Dataset for Evaluating Visio-Linguisic Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.10756). 

### Dataset

Our dataset can be accessed [here](https://zenodo.org/record/6563623#.ZAMJJ3ZBweM). Four reasoning tasks are supported: spatiality, cardinality, numerical comparison and quantifiers. For some of the datasets, we provide two versions which differ only in their training sets: one with 8k training examples, and another with 32k training examples. The validation sets, in-distribution and out-of-distribution test sets are identical. 

### Code

Code for dataset generation: to be released.
